										An Intelligence Quotient indicates a person’s mental abilities relative to others of approximately the same age. Everyone has numerous specific mental abilities, some of which can be measured accurately and are reliable predictors of academic and financial success.
										It is more valuable to look at what IQ tests correlate with than what they measure. IQ tests didn’t arise as measurement tools for theories that immediately proved to correlate with notable outcomes. IQ tests have been tweaked and refined over time to show these correlations - a process similar to natural selection.
